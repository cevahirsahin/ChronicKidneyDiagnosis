Application of machine learning methods on Chronic Kidney Diagnosis

Machine learning is a technology that is increasingly used in the medical field. Machine learning methods in the analysis of data related to chronic kidney disease can have a significant impact on the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of the disease.

For this purpose, this study plans to analyze large data sets using various machine learning algorithms and evaluate their usability in early diagnosis of CKD.

The dataset used in this study consists of 400 samples and 24 features collected from hospital records over a period of approximately 2 months. The dataset has multivariate features and is classified under another field. The relevant task is classification.

The summary of the features included in the dataset is as follows:

age: Patient age bp: Blood pressure sg: Specific gravity al: Albumin su: Sugar
rbc: Red blood cells pc: Pus cell pcc: Clots ba: Bacteria
bgr: Random blood glucose bu: Blood urea sc: Serum creatinine sod: Sodium
pot: Potassium hemo: Hemoglobin pcv: Packed cell volume wc: White blood cell count
rc: Red blood cell count htn: Hypertension dm: Diabetes mellitus
cad: Coronary artery disease appet: Appetite pe: Pedal edema ane: Anemia
